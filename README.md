# Introduction
<br>

This is just a collection of payloads for ATTiny85 (aka the poor man's rubberducky, which I got just for under $4) I made. These can be easily converted to ducky script so if you wanna use them in your hak5 rubber ducky, go for it

**NOTE: The creator is NOT responsible for whatever you do. These codes are made and published just as a proof of concept**
